I will add a to do list here of things we need to make sure we handle. If there is anything else add it.
When task is finished, write next to it done.

- apply discount for those who are accepted as senior
- change role id for those accepted as senior to 3 (done)
- affectedRoute returns an array of results so we should add .first() to get the first result (see first case in delete station endpoint)
- we should handle deleting stations that have null station_positions
